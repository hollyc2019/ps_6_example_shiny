# Shiny App Example

Thanks to Miss Rohatgi for allowing me to share her code for the Shiny App from Problem Set #6. You can see her app in action [here](https://tanyarohatgi.shinyapps.io/typology-2017/). You should be able to clone this repo, open her app.R file, hit "Run App" and create her app for yourself.

Questions? Feel free to ask on Piazza!
